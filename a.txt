What we’ll build

We’ll build a classic and simple Golang API server that connects to a front-end page. Our Golang API server will use:

    MySQL as our database
    GORM as an ORM to interact with our database
    Request router using gorilla/mux
    Logrus for logging 

We’ll be building what’s on the right side of the diagram. The specifications for our API Server are:

    It listens to port 8000 on the localhost
    It has five endpoints: healthz, createItem, getCompletedItems, getIncompleteItems, updateItem, and deleteItem
    The TodoItem model consists of Id, Description, and Completed status attributes
